            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here being a ſolemn Vow upon you, made in Baptiſme, <hi>to keep Gods holy will and Commandments;</hi> it is as neceſsary to underſtand them, as it is to be honeſt men, and not to falſifie or break your word. For an help therefore to the meaneſt capacities in a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of ſuch importance, I have drawn up an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> in this plain and familiar way of Queſtions and Anſwers: not knowing what other courſe to take that would be of ſuch general uſe. For the Ignorant can reap little benefit by that which is purpoſely contrived to the pitch of the wiſe; but there is no man of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that may not ſerve himſelf very much of that which is writ to the ſimple people. And to ſay the truth, the plainer and more common any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:34319:3"/>is, of the greater weight and moment we ſhall find it, and the more every man is concerned in it. Let me intreat you then not to deſpiſe this little Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but to read it deliberately, and ponder every ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in it: For it being ſo brief (that the memory may not be burdened) there is not a word ſuperfluous, which is not neceſſary to the unfolding the ſenſe of the command Search the Scriptures alſo whereby every thing is proved, and afterward ſearch and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your ſelves about the breach of any of theſe Precepts, either in whole or in part. And if the Judgments of God that lie now ſo heavy upon us, have begot any purpoſes of amendment, do not add this new aggravation of your guilt, to break thoſe freſh Vows whereby you have bound your ſelves to God. And for the ſtrengthning of them, <hi>Give your ſelves to Prayer,</hi> as the Pſalmiſts phraſe is Pſ <hi>109.4.</hi> Conſidering alſo ſeriouſly (as an help to that) what it is you ask of God in that form of Prayer which our Lord made, of which I have alſo added a ſhort Explication. And remember withall, that all the Prayers you make will not profit you, unleſs they cauſe you to keep Gods commands better, which is the end likewiſe of all you believe. Read over that which we call the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> and you will find that every branch of it doth naturally bring forth an holy life. When you confeſs God to be the Creator of the World; it plainly implies his Supream Authority over you, and the obedience you owe him upon that account. When you acknowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:34319:3"/>Jeſus to be his Son and your Lord, it lays a neceſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ingagement on you to be governed by thoſe Laws which the Father Almighty hath ſent him to give us. For he died and roſe again to confirm and ſeal them. He aſcended to heaven to take upon him the government of the whole World. And he will come again to Judg both the quick and dead accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their works. And therefore what manner of perſons ought you to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs, that you may be found in peace at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing? But it is not my buſineſs now to expound the Creed; whoſe words are better understood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it's deſigne; which is (I ſay) to lead us to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Gods holy will in all things. That is it which I would gladly promote. And I earneſtly beſeech you that this ſmall labour may have no ſmall effect, but be ſo ſucceſsfull as to excite in you ſuch a <hi>working Faith</hi> as will ſave your ſouls.</p>
            <p>God Almighty take you into his protection, and revoke the Orders he hath given to the deſtroying Angel; that you may not die, but live, to declare the works of the Lord, and to pay your Vows to the moſt High. Amen.</p>
